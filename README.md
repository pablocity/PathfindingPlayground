Sample Unity scenes with objects to test pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, or A*.

Eventually project will let everyone test their algorithms, or adjust parameters in built-in ones.

It was created purely for educational purpose to help people understand and visualise some of the algorithms, also to make it easier to created their own solutions.

Technologies: C#, Unity
